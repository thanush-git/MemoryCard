Live Link 

A simple assignment prescribed by [Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-react-new-memory-card) to get hands on experience with React Hooks such as useStates, useEffects and to revise working with APIs, component structures and data flow in a React project.

Dependencies used:
[Parallax Tilt](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-parallax-tilt)  - For the card's 3D effects
[Pokemon TCG API](https://pokemontcg.io/) - Amazing API that provides you with all the data you want with Pokemon Cards
